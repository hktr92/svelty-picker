User picks a date, bound value (if any) is updated, <code>change</code> event triggered and picker is closed. For time it’s

times and picker will stay open. Select minutes and it will close. Also  event is triggered etc.`,y,l,_=`When using keyboard to change date, bound value is not updated immediately, but only on Enter or on input blur. This is
very important distinction against manual vaue settings.`,x,c,T="Manual-commit mode",b,d,H=`When <code>autocommit</code> is set to <code>false</code>, buttons ‘Ok’ and ‘Cancel’ are shown by default (can be overwritten by custom slot consistent).
